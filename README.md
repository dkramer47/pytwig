# pytwig
A simple template engine modeled after TWIG in pure Python.

I made this for a personal project, and it works for basic templating. It also allows for more tags/functions to be added. It's syntax is based off of TWIG's, so look there for how to use.

There's a lot of improvements that could be made, but it works for basic templates.
